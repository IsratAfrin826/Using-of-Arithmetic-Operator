# Using-of-Arithmetic-Operator
Arithmetic operators are symbols used to perform mathematical calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They are fundamental to various programming languages and mathematical expressions. 
Here's a breakdown of common arithmetic operators:

### Basic Arithmetic Operators:

Addition (+): Adds two operands. For example, 5 + 3 results in 8.

Subtraction (-): Subtracts one operand from another. For example, 8 - 3 results in 5.

Multiplication ():*: Multiplies two operands. For example, 5 * 3 results in 15.

Division (/): Divides one operand by another. For example, 15 / 3 results in 5.

Modulus (%): Returns the remainder after division. For example, 10 % 3 results in 1. 

### Other Important Arithmetic Operators:
Increment (++):

Increases the value of a variable by 1. For example, x++ increases the value of the variable x by 1. 

Decrement (--):

Decreases the value of a variable by 1. For example, x-- decreases the value of the variable x by 1.

Exponentiation ()

:** Raises a number to a power. For example, 2 ** 3 results in 8 (2 to the power of 3).

Floor Division (//):

Divides and returns the integer part of the result. For example, 15 // 3 results in 5.
